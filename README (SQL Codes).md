# Storing all of my SQL Codes as files in this sql branch 

This read me includes the reasoning behind each of the SQL codes and the projects each SQL code is attached to.
**Project 1: Geographic Data Analysis of Asia, Europe, and America**
See the Asia, Europe, and America subcontinent, regions, and countries file for details about the SQL code.
**Purpose of this code is to combine regions,continents, and subcontinents as various keys. So that in excel I can use XLOOKUP to get the continent of each country, region, and subcontinent**
This SQL code is fundamental in assistant me with the column charts measuring the number of regions, continents, and subcontinents in Asia, Europe, and America. 

**Project 2: The Cost of Inequality: Connection between socioeconomic and health outcomes for 12 countries**
### 12 countries included in this project are: Canada, United States of America, France, Mali, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Ghana, Congo, India, Dominican Republic, South Africa, and Colombia.
Here's a list of the different questions I am using to guide my data analysis for this project
1. 	How has college enrollment affected obesity rates across countries from 1992 to 2022?
2. 	How have mortality rate trends differed across countries based on income levels between 1992 and 2022?
3. 	Is there a correlation between health expenditure and life expectancy across countries from 1992 to 2022?
4. 	How have unemployment rates impacted suicide mortality rates and blood pressure rates in 1992-2002 as compared to 2012-2022?
5. 	How did the impact of college enrollment on HIV/AIDS prevalence shift between 2005-2012 as compared to 2013-2022 across income groups?
6. 	How do a nation’s income levels correlate mortality rates and life expectancy rates from 1992 to 2022?
7. 	How did the relationship between current health expenditure and HIV/AIDS prevalence differ between 2005-2013 and 2014-2022 across income-level groups?
8. 	How does nation’s income levels affect blood pressure rates and obesity rates from 1992 to 2022?
There will be a file for the detail of each query used to aid my data analysis process for these questions.
