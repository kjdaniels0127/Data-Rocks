This is a repository showcase all of my data analytics projects. I truly believe that data can be used to solve any business problem. There are six steps to ensure a successful data analysis project.
1st step in the data analytics process is Asking Questions: This helps with defining the problems the data analytics project will solve and what the stakeholder/client expectations are for the project. 
The SMART framework is a good tool for asking questions about the project. SMART framework measures whether questions are Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-Bound
2nd step in the data analytics process is Data Preparation: This involves things like data collection, data transformation, ensuring the data is ethical, and that the data came from a good source.
I would define a good data source as reliable, original, comprhensive, current, and cited. 
3rd step in the data analytics process is Processing the Data to ensure it's clean and accurate: This is to make sure the data is clean. Examples of uncleaned data include too little data, inaccurate data with errors, inconsistent data or outdated data. 
This process of data cleaning can take a while and it's important to spend enough time to make sure the data is as accurate as possible.
4th step in the data analytics process is Analyzing the Data: which involves organizing the data, performing data calculations, agreggating the data, and formatting and adjusting the data to ensure it's in the correct format. 
5th step in the data analytics process is Sharing Data through Visualizations: This involves creating data visualizations. Specific type of data visualizations include things like pie charts, bar charts, heat maps, and column charts
Then communicating your data insights to the stakeholders/client in a clear and concise matter. This is also where the data analyst makes recommendations to the shareholders/client. 
6th step in the data analytics process is the Act Phase: Where the stakeholder/client takes the recommendations the data analyst made and implements them.
