**Welcome to my data analytics portfolio** 

Here's a collection of projects that demonstrate my ability to extract data insights, solve business problems, and communicate data effectively using tools like **Excel, SQL, Powerpoint and Tableau**.

I believe data can solve virtually any problem when analyzed correctly. To guide my approach, I follow a structured **6-step analytics process**:

1. **Ask Smart Questions**  
   Define the problem clearly using the SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, Time-Bound). Communicate clearly with the stakeholder and client to fully understand the expectations Then generate questions based on the client and stakeholder's needs using the SMART framework. 

2. **Prepare the Data**  
   Gather reliable, ethical data from reputable sources and ensure it's suitable and the data is as unbiased as possible for the data analytics questions you are attempting to answer.

3. **Clean the Data**  
   Clean the data utilizing tools like ***Excel, SQL, coding programs (Python and R)***  by looking for missing, outdated, and transform the data into useful formats for the data analytics process.
   
5. **Analyze the Data**  
   Use aggregation, transformation, and data calculation methods to uncover patterns and insights.

6. **Share Insights with Visualizations**  
   Communicate findings through clear, concise visuals (e.g., bar charts, scatterplots, heat maps, and pivot tables) and make data-driven recommendations.

7. **Drive Action**  
   After sharing the data insights this is when the stakeholder or client can take action based on the data-driven recommendations.

   ## ðŸ”§ Tools & Skills Demonstrated:
- **Excel**: Pivot Tables, XLOOKUP, IF statements, Charts, and Complex Formulas
- **SQL**: Basic to Intermeidate Queries like Select, From, Where, Concat, column aliasing. 
- **Tableau/Power BI**: Creating data visualizations like heatmaps, bar graphs, scatterplots, or data summary tables.
