# Welcome to my data analytics portfolio 

Here's a collection of projects that demonstrate my ability to extract data insights, solve business problems, and communicate data effectively using tools like **Excel, SQL, Powerpoint and Tableau**.

I believe data can solve virtually any problem when analyzed correctly. To guide my approach, I follow a structured **6-step analytics process**:

1. **Ask Smart Questions**  
   Define the problem clearly using the SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, Time-Bound). Communicate clearly with the stakeholder and client to fully understand the expectations Then generate questions based on the client and stakeholder's needs using the SMART framework. 

2. **Prepare the Data**  
   Gather reliable, ethical data from reputable sources and ensure it's suitable and the data is as unbiased as possible for the data analytics questions you are attempting to answer.

3. **Clean the Data**  
   Clean the data utilizing tools like ***Excel, SQL, coding programs (Python and R)***  by looking for missing, outdated, and transform the data into useful formats for the data analytics process.
   
5. **Analyze the Data**  
   Use aggregation, transformation, and data calculation methods to uncover patterns and insights.

6. **Share Insights with Visualizations**  
   Communicate findings through clear, concise visuals (e.g., bar charts, scatterplots, heat maps, and pivot tables) and make data-driven recommendations.

7. **Drive Action**  
   After sharing the data insights this is when the stakeholder or client can take action based on the data-driven recommendations.

   ## ðŸ”§ Tools & Skills Demonstrated:
- **Excel**: Pivot Tables, XLOOKUP, IF statements, Charts, Macros and Complex Formulas
- **SQL**: Basic to Intermeidate Queries Select, From, Where, Concat, column aliasing. SQL Calculations using aggregate functions, Subqueries, CTEs and creating new tables 
- **Tableau/Power BI**: Creating data visualizations like heatmaps, bar graphs, scatterplots, or data summary tables.
- **Chat GPT**: For prepping SQL queries and assisting in coming up with new queries to use.

**Data Insights about Americas, Asia, and Europe continents**

1.Europe has the most regions and countries at 592 and 25, respectively.

2.Americas has the least regions and countries at 242 and 12, respectively.

3.There are 4 subcontinents in America, Asia, and Europe.

![Obesity Rates and College Enrollment Rates ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe8864e7-84c3-4439-bfea-7587a59e9987) 

1. Positive correlation obesity rates and enrollment rates
2. Outlier: South Africa relatively high obesity rate at 23.63% and mid college enrollment at 20.48% which is sixth among countries.

![Mortality Rate by Income](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daf48b95-834a-421e-bc13-a5f2fb326615)

1. Strong negative correlation mortality rates and income levels
2. South Africa was the outlier as an upper middle income nation with a relatively high mortalilty rate at 121.1. Which is higher than lower middle income nations Ghana and India and a bit lower than Congo. 
![Life Expectancy and Health Expenditure % of GDP ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f97248cb-f1e7-4b70-94a2-11365181032a)

1. Slight to moderate positive correlation health expenditure and life expectancy
2. Outlier: South Africa spent over 10% on health expenditure and low life expectancy of 61.44
3. Outlier: Afghanistan spent over 8% on health expenditure and low life expectancy of 60.25
![1992-2002 and 2012-2022 Unemployment Rate, BP Rate and Suicide Mortality Rate](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be112836-b7b2-460d-af98-26b9c006eac2)

1. Slight positive correlation between unemployment rates and raised BP rates
2. Slight positive correaltion between unemployment rates and suicide mortality rates
3. UE rates slightly decreased in 2012-2022 from 1992-2002 for most countries
4. Canada and France saw notable decreases in raised BP rates in 2012-2022 from 1992-2002 at 13.13% and 8%, respectively.
5. No significant change in suicide mortaity rates in 2012-2022 from 1992-2002 for most countries.

1. No correlation HIV Incidence rates and college enrollment rates or income levels

3. Positive correlation income levels and college enrollment rates
4. Slight negative correlation between HIV Incidence rates and income status in both 2005-2012 and 2013-2020
![Life Expectancy and Mortality Rates by Income](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/748235d0-4a51-40c6-b5c2-8a420ee804df)

1. Moderate positive correlation between life expectancu and income levels
2. Outlier: South Africa there's life expectancy at 61.44 in the bottom three as an upper-middle income nation
3. I strongly suspect that South Africa having the highest HIV rates in the world per National Library of Medecine plays a significant role in the life expectancy.
4. No suprise here as income levels of a nation do a play a significant role in having higher quality healthcare services that can prevent premature deaths and extend the lifespan of individuals.
